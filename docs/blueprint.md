# **App Name**: AI Code Weaver

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Code Generation: Generates code snippets based on user prompts using the Gemini 2.0 Flash API. The tool will determine the optimal code structure, libraries, and algorithms based on the prompt.
- Prompt Input & Code Display: Allows users to input prompts and view the generated code.
- Code Preview & Download: Combines the generated code files and provides a preview of the project. The project can be downloaded as a .zip file.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#1A237E) for a professional and coding-focused feel.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) for backgrounds and content separation.
- Accent: Teal (#00BCD4) for interactive elements like buttons and links.
- Split-screen layout with the prompt input on the left and the code display/preview on the right.
- Use code-related icons (brackets, tags, etc.) for visual cues and navigation.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading states and code generation processes.
